-- Revised analysis: edge aggregates of the two graphs at one anchor (T_obs or a freeze date)
-- from the listed-token ego events of 12_usd_ego.sql, with amounts in USD.
-- Parameters: @start_ts, @anchor_ts (inclusive), @b_transfer, @b_allowance (value-transform
-- slopes, 1/USD), @cap_allowance (USD at which an allowance is capped in the C-PR allowance
-- layer). The constants come from 13_usd_constants.sql and docs/revision_price_weighting.md.
-- __TAG__ names the anchor (tobs, t1). Decay as in 04_anchor_pairs.sql: k = 0.01, t0 = 180 days.
--
-- u_allow_triples___TAG__: latest approval of each (token, owner, spender) up to the anchor,
--   in (block number, log index) order, kept when its value is positive; usd = amount x the
--   token's price on the UTC day of the anchor.
-- u_allow_pairs___TAG__:   per (owner, spender): tokens, EndorseRank weight sum sigma*V(usd),
--   capped USD allowance sum (C-PR allowance layer), largest sigma, latest approval time,
--   and the EndorseRank weights with the slope multiplied and divided by ten (sensitivity).
-- u_transfer_pairs___TAG__: per (sender, recipient): transfers, AWP weight sum sigma*V(usd),
--   USD layer sum usd*sigma (C-PR transfer layer), largest sigma (AWP activeness), summed USD,
--   first and last transfer time, and the AWP weights with the slope multiplied and divided by ten.
