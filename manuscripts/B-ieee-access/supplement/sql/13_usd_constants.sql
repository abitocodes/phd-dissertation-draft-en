-- Revised analysis: the USD scale constants, from events up to the earliest freeze t1
-- (31 March 2026) only, so that no event of a label window enters them.
-- Parameters: @start_ts, @t1 (inclusive), @unlimited (base units at or above which an allowance
-- is unlimited, as in 10_describe.sql). Destination: contract_rep.u_constants (one row).
--
-- m_transfer:  median USD value of the ego transfers of listed tokens up to t1.
-- m_allowance: median USD value, at t1 prices, of the finite positive latest allowances at t1.
-- p99_allowance: 99th percentile of the same finite allowances (reported; see below).
-- p99_transfer: 99th percentile of the USD values of the transfers; the C-PR allowance cap U
--   (docs/revision_price_weighting.md, section 5, as amended before any revised score).
-- Quantiles are BigQuery APPROX_QUANTILES over 10,000 buckets; the constants of the analysis
-- are these values rounded to two significant digits (docs/revision_price_weighting.md).
